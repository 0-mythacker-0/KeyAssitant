### Idea: AutoHotKey Alternative
#### Moto: Type less, Gain the best

Make a application which will allow us to shorten our time in typing. As example: if I type **asap** then it will automatically replace that **asap** with *as soon as possible*. Those acronym can be setted by the user.

> My google search

I searched on this and found some alternative libraries that can be used for it. For 

nodejs: **robotjs** could be an option. But that doesn't support hotkey as the creator said. **NWjs** could useful here because the creator of **robotjs** use this library for hotkey kind of stuff.

c++/c: We could use WinApi or QtHotkey(for GUI access : Framwork QT). 

> note:

There are so many ways to do this. But I want a GUI for quickly change the acronym. We could use NodeJs or C++ or other language. If you suggesstion in any let me know.
